# Erasmus Python Calculator

This project is a simple **Python console application** developed as part of my personal Erasmus portfolio.  
The calculator allows users to **perform basic arithmetic operations** and keeps a short history of the last operations during the session.

## Features
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Display the last 5 operations in a session  
- Input validation and protection against division by zero  
- Clean and user-friendly terminal interface  

## Technologies
- Python 3  
- Console application  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Navigate to the project folder (`cd calculadora-erasmus`)  
3. Run the calculator: `python calculadora.py`  
4. Follow the instructions in the terminal. Type `sair` to exit  

## Purpose
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with **Python fundamentals**  
- Implement **functions, loops, and conditionals**  
- Create **console-based applications** with user interaction  
- Maintain **clean and structured code**, suitable for a professional portfolio
